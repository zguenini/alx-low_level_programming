# Mastering C Programming: From Fundamentals to Advanced Concepts

## Description

Mastering C Programming: From Fundamentals to Advanced Concepts is a comprehensive repository designed to help you become proficient in the C programming language. Whether you are a beginner or have some programming experience, this repository provides the necessary knowledge and hands-on exercises to master C programming. Starting from the basics, such as variables, data types, and control flow, the repository progresses to more advanced topics like arrays, pointers, file handling, and dynamic memory allocation. With detailed explanations, code examples, and projects, you will gain a deep understanding of C programming and develop practical skills.

## About
 This repository consists of all [***Alx-Low_Level_programming***](./) projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [Zguenini](https://github.com/zguenini).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

## Project

[0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world): This directory covers the basics of C programming and guides beginners through writing and compiling a simple "Hello, World" program in C.

[0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while): This directory explores essential concepts such as variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loop structures (while) in C. It teaches how to declare and initialize variables, perform conditional checks, and create loops for iterative operations.

[0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](0x02-functions_nested_loops): This directory expands on C programming by introducing functions and nested loops. Learners will understand how to create and use functions, pass arguments, and return values. They will also explore the concept of nested loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

[0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging): This directory focuses on the crucial skill of debugging code. It covers common types of bugs in C programs and introduces debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix errors effectively. Debugging skills are essential for understanding code behavior and ensuring program functionality.
