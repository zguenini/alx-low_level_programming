## Project

[0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world): This directory covers the basics of C programming and guides beginners through writing and compiling a simple "Hello, World" program in C.

[0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while): This directory explores essential concepts such as variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loop structures (while) in C. It teaches how to declare and initialize variables, perform conditional checks, and create loops for iterative operations.

[0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](0x02-functions_nested_loops): This directory expands on C programming by introducing functions and nested loops. Learners will understand how to create and use functions, pass arguments, and return values. They will also explore the concept of nested loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

[0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging): This directory focuses on the crucial skill of debugging code. It covers common types of bugs in C programs and introduces debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix errors effectively. Debugging skills are essential for understanding code behavior and ensuring program functionality.
