## Project

[0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world): directory focuses on introducing the basics of C programming. It provides a foundational understanding of how to write and compile a simple "Hello, World" program in C. This section serves as a starting point for beginners, helping them get familiar with the C programming environment and the process of running a C program.

[0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while): directory delves into essential concepts such as variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loop structures (while) in C. It explores how to declare and initialize variables, perform conditional checks, and create loops for iterative operations. This section builds upon the foundational knowledge gained in the previous section, enabling learners to write more complex C programs by incorporating variables, conditionals, and loops.
